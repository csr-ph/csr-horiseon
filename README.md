Refactored the site to clean up the CSS by merging multiple classes into one to make it cleaner, correctly linking sections of the page with the <nav> element, and replacing <div> elements with <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, etc. Also commented the CSS to separate sections of code from one another to avoid confusion.
